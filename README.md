# Information Systems Security Project
Using the CBC method, this project offers a way to encrypt and decrypt text data with a 8-bit key, consisted of 8 characters of the english alphabet.<br>
After implementing this tool, by a given ciphered text, a brute-force method was applied in order to decrypt the ciphertext in less than a minute.<br>
It was also tested on a Plaintext Attack, this time with a 56-bit key.
